# ⚡ LuxForge

Welcome to LuxForge—a homelab archive forged from edge-case fixes, timestamped incident logs, and a relentless pursuit of understanding the *why* behind every solution.

## 🧠 Who’s Behind LuxForge?

LuxForge is the pseudonymous identity of a resilient tinkerer operating out of ShinxLab, a hands-on homelab where VLANs are mapped, firewalls are bent to will, and every fix is documented with precision and flair. I specialize in:

- Advanced Linux and Proxmox system administration  
- Forensic packet analysis and multi-VLAN troubleshooting  
- Markdown-driven documentation with ASCII branding and tag-based indexing  

## 📚 Why This Blog Exists

LuxForge isn’t just a collection of fixes—it’s a reproducible knowledge base. Every post is timestamped, narrative-driven, and designed to help others navigate the same obscure issues I’ve faced. Whether it’s a pfSense bridge anomaly or a creative hardware mod, it’s all logged here.

## 🛠️ What You’ll Find

- **Incident Logs**: Real-world technical breakdowns with timelines, screenshots, and reflections  
- **Workflow Experiments**: Creative setups, branding riffs, and documentation strategies  
- **Signature Style**: ASCII headers, tag-driven navigation, and a Luxray-inspired aesthetic  

## 🕶️ Anonymity with Identity

I value privacy—but I also believe in recognizable work. LuxForge is my way of blending technical mastery with creative branding, making each solution memorable and reproducible.
